### Background
Apple Swift Playgrounds' Battleship challege \[[1](#notes)\] comes pre-loaded with three solutions of varying complexity and performance (number of turns needed to finish game on average):

Solution    | Average turns per game | # lines of code \[[2](#notes)\]
---------------------- | --- | ---
_Sinking a Ship_       | 92 | 21
_Locatig Ships_        | 69 | 48
_An Example Algorithm_ | 62 | 148
**_My Solution_**        | **_56_** | **_116_**

Here I explain the concept behind my solution, which needs only 56 turns on average to finish the game.
